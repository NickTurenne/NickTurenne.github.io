      <b>My name is Nick Turenne and I am 4th year computing science student at SFU. I have a passion for learning and all things computers including, software development, game development, data science, computer hardware, AI, and more. 
        Outside of the classroom I enjoy playing lacrosse for the team at SFU, hiking, reading, and watching MMA/UFC. I began my programming journey in highschool where I learned the fundamentals of programming with python and ever since I have been hooked.
        I am an avid learner and enjoy figuring out how various systems and computer related technologies work. Some of my favourite courses I have taken at SFU include: CMPT 404: Cryptography; CMPT 300: Operating Systems; CMPT 362: Mobile Application Developement; and CMPT 410: Machine Learning.
