      <h1 class="header">About</h1>
      <p>My name is Nick Turenne and I am 4th year computing science student at SFU. I have a passion for learning and all things computers including, software development, game development, data science, computer hardware, AI, and more. 
        Outside of the classroom I enjoy playing lacrosse for the team at SFU, hiking, reading, and watching MMA/UFC. I began my programming journey in highschool where I learned the fundamentals of programming with python and ever since I have been hooked.
        I am an avid learner and enjoy figuring out how various systems and computer related technologies work. Some of my favourite courses I have taken at SFU include: CMPT 404: Cryptography; CMPT 300: Operating Systems; CMPT 362: Mobile Application Developement; and CMPT 410: Machine Learning.

            <li>Beyond the Quintessence is a roguelike game made using C# and the Unity engine and has been a side project of mine for a while. The game utilizes various object oriented programming patterns, pathfinding algorithms, and procedural generation techniques in order to achieve the desired gameplay loop.
               The game is available for download on the game sharing website itch.io and has been downloaded and played by users on the site. I still periodically work on and update the game when I have new ideas for content.</li>

            <li>This project scrapes UFC fight matchup data for the fighters scheduled on the next UFC event and saves the parsed information in a JSON file. The JSON file is then read and fighter stats are displayed side by side for quick and efficient analysis.</li>

            <li>September - December 2024</li>
            <li>This was a group project I completed for my class CMPT 362: Mobile Application Developement. ArtChart is an Android app that was developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. The app is designed to be a collection of user submitted street art and public art pieces. 
              The app allows users to create an account, view submitted artwork using the Google Maps API, submit artwork to the database, and leave reviews for art pieces as well.</li>
